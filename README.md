# Crystallized-Crops


Crystalized Crops is a mod similar to (atleast will be similar) magical crops/mystical crops/what ever mods are like this - this mod adds hopefully vanilla ballenced "crystalized" crops.


lore:

crystailzed crops are some sort of mutated flower, that has joined with a living crystal. This living crystal grows with the plant, and is the heart of said plant. Just about any plant can be mutated by these crystals, so there are no seeds in this mod other then for the crystals at the start of the game.


[WARNING I MAY BE GOING OFF THE DEEP END]
I had a dream where I was at a wedding, (I think for my parents) and i went to a garden area, where there were plants on the ground, and i broke them like i was in minecraft, then i got some crystalized seeds from some special flowers that grew among a patch of white flowers.
