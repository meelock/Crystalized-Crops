# Crystallized-Crops


Crystalized Crops is a mod similar to (atleast will be similar) magical crops/mystical crops/what ever mods are like this - this mod adds hopefully vanilla ballenced "crystalized" crops.


lore:

Crystaillzed crops are some sort of mutated flower, that has joined with a living crystal. This living crystal grows with the plant, and is the heart of said plant. Just about any plant can be mutated by these crystals, so that it is intended that crops from this mod are living crystals instead of "magical" plants, however it is planned that a form of automation for these crops will be added.


[WARNING I MAY BE GOING OFF THE DEEP END]
I had a dream where I was at a wedding, (I think for my parents) and i went to a garden area, where there were plants on the ground, and i broke them like i was in minecraft, then i got some crystalized seeds from some special flowers that grew among a patch of white flowers.
